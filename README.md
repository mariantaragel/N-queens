# N queens

This Python script converts the [N-queens Problem](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/queens) to CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form). The SAT solver can be used to check whether the CNF formula is satisfiable and obtain the model.

## Example

```sh
$ python3 queens.py N
```

**N** - number of queens N and chessboard size N x N
